ZLIB on Marmalade
===============

This module can be used to build the standard zlib compression
and decompression into your Marmalade application.

The source is compiled unmodified from:

    http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz

There 'minigzip.mkb' example will compress the file call test.txt
in the data folder.
